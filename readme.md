## Tools and packages

This application uses many tools and packages, the packages can 
be seen in the [composer.json](http://gitlab.yipl.com.np/web-apps/agentcis/blob/master/composer.json) file and javascript

## Structure

The application is structured in a very simple way in `app\Nrgi` folder.

Nrgi folder contains other 3 folders
- Repositories: Contains all the classes for storage and retrival from database. 
- Entities: Contains all the eloquent model classes.
- Services: Contains the classes which serves as the intermediate for Controllers and Repositories. All the application logic are handled here. Logger is also implemented inside services. The purpose of using services is to keep our controllers slim.

Classes inside each of the above directories are properly written within corresponding modules namespace.
