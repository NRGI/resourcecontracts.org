   <br /><br />
     1600 square kilometers of 3D seismic survey;<br /><br />
     600 kilometers of 2D seismic survey;and<br /><br />
     marine studies,geological and geophysical studies.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.3. The Contractor during the second exploration period defined in Article 3.2 shall carry out the following minimum work.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    1 exploratory well.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.4. The Contractor, during the third exploration period   defined in Article 3.3 shall carry out the following minimum work <br /><br />
<br /><br />
   2  exploratory wells.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.5. Each of the exploratory wells referred to above <br /><br />
     shall  be drilled to a minimum depth of 1,000 <br /><br />
     meters,<br /><br />
     after deduction of the water depth, or to a lesser<br /><br />
     depth if the continuation of drilling performed in <br /><br />
     accordance with good international petroleum <br /><br />
     industry practice is prevented for any of the <br /><br />
     following   reasons:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
     (a) the basement is encountered at a lesser depth <br /><br />
         than the minimum contractual depth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
     (b) continuation of drilling presents an obvious <br /><br />
         danger  due to the existence of abnormal <br /><br />
         formation  pressure.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
     (c) rock formations are encountered the hardness of<br /><br />
         which prevents in practice , the continuation <br /><br />
         of drilling by the use of appropriate <br /><br />
        equipment;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
     (d) petroleum formations are encountered the <br /><br />
         crossing of which requires for their protection<br /><br />
         the laying of casings preventing the minimum<br /><br />
        contractual depth from being reached.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
   [signature]                   [signature]  10 In the event that any of the above reasons occurs,the exploratory  well shall be deemed to have been drilled to the minimum contractual depth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding any provision in this Article to the contrary,NOCAL and the Contractor may at any time,agree to abandon the drilling of a well at a lesser depth than the minimum contractual depth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.6. In order to carry out the exploration work defined <br /><br />

VALUATION OF PETROLEUM<br /><br />
<br /><br />
18.1. For the purposes of cost recovery under this Contract, the Crude Oil price shall be the F.O.B “Market Price” at the Delivery point, expressed in Doltars per Barrol and payable within thirty (30) days after the date of the till of loding, as determined hereinafter for each Calendar Quarter.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A Market Price shall be determined for each type of Crude Oil or Crude Oil mix.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
18.1 The Market Price applicable to illing of Crude Oil made during a Calender Quarter shall be calculated at the end of said quarter and shall be equal to the weighted average of the prices obtained for Crude Oil from the Delimited Area during said quarter by the Contractor and by NOCA from independent purchasers, as adjusted to take into account the difference in quality and gravity as well as in F.O.B. delivery terms, contract term and payment conditions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
18.3 In the event such sales are not made, the Market Price shall be determined on the basis of the prices obtained on the international and domestic market during said quarter between independent buyers and sellers for sales of crude oils of quality similar to the Crude Oil from the Delimited Area in the same markets as those in which the Liberian Crude Oil should normally be sold, as adjusted to take into account the differences in quality, quantity, gravity, transportation as well as in sales and payment conditions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
18.4 In the following transaction shall be executed from the calculation of the Market Price of Crude Oil:<br /><br />
(a)	sales in which the buyor in the Affilicated Company of the seller as well as sales between entities constituring the Contaractor.<br /><br />
(b)	Sales in exchange for other than payment in freely convertible currencies and sales fully or partially made for reasons other than the usual economic incentives involved in Crude Oil sales on the international market (such as exchange contracts, sales from government to government or to government agencies).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
18.5 Within ten (10) days following the end of each Calender Quarter, the Parties shall advise each other of the prices obtained for their share of production of Crude Oil from the Delimited Area sold to independent purchasers during the quarter in question, indicating for each sale the identify of the purchaser, the quantities sold, the delivery and payment terms.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Within twenty (20) days following the end of each quarter, the Contractor shall determine in accordance with the provisions of Article 18.2 or Article 18.3, as the case may be, the Market Price applicable for the quarter concerned, and shall notify NOCAL of that Market Price, indicating the method of calculation and all data used in the calculation of that Market Price.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Within thirty (30) days following receipt of the notice referred to in the preceding paragraph, NOCAL shall verify that the calculation of Market Price complies with the provisions hereof and shall notify the Contractor of its acceptance or objections. Failing notification from NOCAL within that thirty (30) day period the Market Price provided for in the Contractor's notice referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be deemed to have been accepted by NOCAL.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that NOCAL has notified objections to the Market Price, the Parties shall meet within fifteen (15) days following NOCAL's notification to mutually agree on the Market Price. If the Parties fail to agree on the Market Price applicable to a given quarter within seventy-five (75) days after the end of that quarter, NOCAL or the Contractor may immediately submit to an expert, appointed in accordance with the following paragraph, the determination of the Market Price (including the determination of reference crude oils if the Parties have not determined them). The expert shall determine the price within thirty (30) days after his appointment and his conclusions shall be final and binding on the Parties. The expert shall decide in accordance with the provision of this Article.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
18.5.   In the event it would be necessary to calculate on a provisional basis during a Calendar Quarter the Crude Oil price applicable to the liftings made during said quarter, that price shall be established as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  (a)   For any sale to independent buyers, the price applicable to that sale shall be the price obtained for the Crude Oil for said sale, as adjusted to take into account the F.O.B. delivery terms and thirty (30) days payment terms.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  (b)   For any lifting other than those which are the subject of a sale to independent buyers, the price applicable to that lifting shall be the Market Price determined for the preceding quarter or, if that Market<br /><br />

          OWNERSHIP AND ABANDONMENT OF ASSETS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
20.1.   Upon expiration, surrender or termination of this Contract, whatever the reason thereof, in respect of all or part of the Delimited Area, or at the end of exploitation of a Field if they are not otherwise required for the Petroleum Operations under this Contract, the Contractor shall transfer at no cost to NOCAL, on an 'as is where is basis', the ownership of assets, movables and immovables owned by the Contractor used for the requirements of the Petroleum Operations carried out in the area so surrendered, located whether inside or outside the Delimited Area (but within Liberia), such as wells and their equipment, buildings, warehouses, docks, lands, offices, plants, machinery and equipment, bases, harbors, wharfs, jetties, buoys, platforms, pipelines, roads, bridges, railroads and other facilities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Such transfer of ownership shall cause the automatic cancellation of any security or surety concerning those assets, or which those assets constitute.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
However, the Contractor may continue to use those assets beyond the date referred to in the first paragraph, for the requirements of its Petroleum Operations in Liberia governed by other contracts.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Within sixty (60) days after the Contractor commences production operations in respect of a Field, NOCAL will notify the Contractor which, if any, assets it will want to have transferred to it at the end of the exploitation or a Field (subject to Article 20.1). The Contractor shall make provision for the anticipated costs of abandonment, decommissioning and reclamation for the remaining assets in accordance with internationally accepted accounting standards to enable cost recovery of such costs over the producing life of the Field. At lease two (2) years before any assets would be abandoned and decommissioned, the Contractor will notify NOCAL and NOCAL will, within sixty (60) days, confirm whether or not it wishes to have those assets transferred to it. Appropriate adjustments to the cost provisioning will be made should NOCAL change the assets it requires to have transferred to it from those notified to the Contractor at the commencement of productions operations of a Field.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
20.2.   If NOCAL decides not to accept, for all or part of the assets, the transfer of ownership provided for in Article 20.1, it may, not later than ninety (90) days following the date specified in said Article, require the Contractor, in accordance with good international petroleum industry practice, to perform abandonment   operations and to remove, at the cost of the Contractor, the facilities relating to the surrendered area.<br /><br />

NATURAL GAS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.1. Non-Associated Natural Gas<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.1.1. In the event of a Non-Associated Natural Gas discovery, the Contractor shall engage in discussions with NOCAL with a view to determining whether the appraisal and exploitation of said discovery have a potentially commercial nature.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.1.2. If the Contractor, after the above-mentioned discussions, considers that the appraisal of such Non-Associated Natural Gas discovery is justified. It shall undertake the appraisal work program for said discovery.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall have the right, for the purposes of evaluating the commerciality of the Non-Associated Natural Gas discovery. If it so requests at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the third exploration period set forth in Article 3.3 to be granted an exclusive appraisal authorization concerning the Appraisal Perimeter of the above-mentioned discovery, for a team of three (3) years.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In addition, the Parties shall jointly evaluate the possible outlets for the Natural Gas, both on the local market and for export, together with the necessary means for its marketing, and they shall consider the possibility of a joint marketing of their shares of production in the event the Natural Gas discovery would not otherwise be commercially exploitable. For that purpose, a Consultative Committee for Natural Gas shall be established by the Parties to ensure the coordination of the upstream and downstream components of the Natural Gas project and facilitate its evaluation and implementation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.1.3 If, despite their reasonable endeavours, the Parties are not able to develop a market for a Non-Associated Natural Gas discovery, the Contractor may, prior to the expiry of the term of the exclusive appraisal authorization, request a further three (3) year extension of the exclusive appraisal authorization for the Appraisal Perimeter of the discovery. Further extensions of the exclusive appraisal authorization may be requested by the Contractor prior to the expiry of the then current authorization. NOCAL will not unreasonably withhold its approval for those extensions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Following completion of appraisal work, in the event the Parties should jointly decide that the exploitation of that discovery is justified to supply the local market, or in the event the Contractor should undertake to develop<br /><br />
<br /><br />
41       and produce that Natural Gas for export, the <br /><br />
       Contractor shall submit prior to the <br /><br />
       expiration of the appraisal period an <br /><br />
       application for an exclusive exploitation <br /><br />
       authorization which NOCAL will grant under <br /><br />
       the terms provided by Article 12.1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
       The Contractor shall then have the right and <br /><br />
       obligation to proceed with the development <br /><br />
       plan referred to in Article 1.3 and the    <br /><br />
       provisions of this Contract applicable to  <br /><br />
       Crude Oil shall apply, mutual s mutandis, to <br /><br />
       Natural Gas, unless otherwise specifically <br /><br />
       provided under Article 21.3 or in other <br /><br />
       provisions of this Contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.1.4 If the Contractor considers land informs <br /><br />
       NOCAL accordingly) that the appraisal of the <br /><br />
       Non-Associated Natural Gas discovery <br /><br />
       concerned is not justified, other than due <br /><br />
       to a lack of a market for the gas on <br /><br />
       commercial terms in accordance with <br /><br />
       international  industry practice NOCAL may <br /><br />
       by giving twelve (12) months prior notice <br /><br />
       which may be reduced either with <br /><br />
       Contractor's consent or automatically in the <br /><br />
       event the exclusive exploration <br /><br />
       authorization expires earlier, require the  <br /><br />
       Contractor to surrender its rights in <br /><br />
       respect of the area encompassing said <br /><br />
       discovery.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
       In the same manner, if the Contractor, after <br /><br />
       completion of appraisal works considers (and <br /><br />
       informs NOCAL accordingly) that the Non- <br /><br />
       Associated Natural Gas discovery is not <br /><br />
       commercial, other than due to a lack of a <br /><br />
       market for the gas on commercial terms in <br /><br />
       accordance with international industry <br /><br />
       practice, NOCAL may by giving three (3) <br /><br />
       months prior notice, unless the exclusive <br /><br />
       exploration authorization expires earlier, <br /><br />
       require the Contractor to surrender its <br /><br />
       rights on the area encompassing said <br /><br />
       discovery.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.1.5 If the Contractor is on the view that Non-<br /><br />
       Association Gas discovery in question is <br /><br />
       non-economic as a standalone development but <br /><br />
       can demonstrate that there is sufficient <br /><br />
       prospectively in the region to support a <br /><br />
       combined development of current discovered <br /><br />
       reserves and future exploration prospects as <br /><br />
       a combined economic development, then the <br /><br />
       prior notice to be given by NOCAL under <br /><br />
       Article 21.1.4 in both paragraphs 1 and 2) <br /><br />
       will be no less thirty six (36) months <br /><br />
       during which time the Contractor will have <br /><br />
       the same rights an unclear an exclusive <br /><br />
       appraisal authorization (and whether or not <br /><br />
       the Contractor has an exclusive appraisal     <br /><br />
       authorization which is otherwise scheduled <br /><br />
       to end prior to the expiry of that 36 month <br /><br />
       period).<br /><br />

<br /><br />
21.2 Associated Natural Gas<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.2.1. In the event of a a commercial discovery of <br /><br />
        Crude Oil, the Contractor shall state if it <br /><br />
        considers that the production of Associated <br /><br />
        Natural Gas is likely to exceed the quantities <br /><br />
        necessary for the requirements of the Petroleum <br /><br />
        Operations related to the production of Crude <br /><br />
        Oil (including re injection operations), and if <br /><br />
        it considers that such excess is  capable of <br /><br />
        being produced in commercial quantities. In  the <br /><br />
        event the Contractor shall have informed NOCAL <br /><br />
        of such an excess, the Parties shall jointly <br /><br />
        evaluate the possible outlets for that excess of <br /><br />
        Natural Gas, both on the local market and for <br /><br />
        export (including the possibility of joint <br /><br />
        marketing of their shares of production of that <br /><br />
        excess of Natural Gas in the event such excess <br /><br />
        would not otherwise be commercially <br /><br />
        exploitable), together with the means necessary <br /><br />
        for its marketing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
        In the event the Parties should decide that the <br /><br />
        development of the excess of Natural Gas is <br /><br />
        justified  or in the event the Contractor would <br /><br />
        wish to develop and produce that excess for <br /><br />
        export, the Contractor shall indicate in the <br /><br />
        development and production program referred to <br /><br />
        in Article 11.3.3 the additional facilities <br /><br />
        necessary for the development and exploitation <br /><br />
        of that excess and its estimate of the costs <br /><br />
        related thereto.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
        The Contractor shall then have the right to <br /><br />
        proceed with the development and production <br /><br />
        program approved by NOCAL under the terms <br /><br />
        provided by Article 11.3.6. and the provisions <br /><br />
        of the Contract applicable to Crude Oil shall <br /><br />
        apply, mutatis mutandis, to excess of Natural <br /><br />
        gas, unless otherwise specifically provided by <br /><br />
        Article 21.3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
        A similar procedure shall be applicable if the <br /><br />
        sale or marketing of Associated Natural gas is <br /><br />
        decided during the exploitation of a Field.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.2.22 In the event the Contractor should not consider <br /><br />
        the exploitation of the excess of Natural Gas as <br /><br />
        justified and if NOCAL at any time thereafter, <br /><br />
        would wish to utilize it. NOCAL shall notify the <br /><br />
        Contractor thereof, in which event.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
       (a) the Contractor shall make available to NOCAL <br /><br />
           free of change at the Crude Oil and Natural <br /><br />
           Gas separation facilities all or part of the <br /><br />
           excess that NOCAL wishes to it;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
       (b) NOCAL shall be responsible for the gathering, <br /><br />
           processing, compressing and transporting of <br /><br />
           that excess from the above mentioned <br /><br />
           separation facilities, and shall bear any <br /><br />
           Petroleum Costs related thereto;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
                                               43	(c)	the construction of the facilities necessary for the operations referred to in paragaraph (b) above, together with the lifitng of that excess by NOCAL, shall be carried out in accordance with good international petroleum industry practice and in such a manner as not to hinder the production, lifting and transportation of Crude Oil by the Contractor.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.2.3.	Any excess of Associated Natural Gas which would not be utilized under Articles 21.2.1. and 21.2.2. shall be reinfected by the Contractor, HOwever, the Contractor shall have the right to hence said gas in accordance with good international petroleum industry practice, provided that the Contractor furnishes NOCAL with a report demonstrating that said gas cannot be economically utilized to improve the rate of recovery of Crude Oil by means of reinjection pursuant to the provisions of Article 15.6., and provided, further, that NOCAL approves said finning, which approval shall not be unressonably withheld.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.3	Provisions common to Associated and Non-Associated Gas<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.3.1.  In addition to the provisions of Article 10 in order encourage the exploitation of Natural Gas, NOCAL may grant to the Contractor further specific benefits when they are duty justified concerning. Inter alia, the recovery of the Petroleum Costs retaining to Natural Gas.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.3.2.  The Contractor shall have the right to dispose of its share of production of Natural Gas, in accordance with the provisions of this Contract, it shall also have the right to proceed with the separation of liquids from all Natural Gas produced, and to transport, store as well as sell on the local market or for export its share of liquid Petroleum so seperated which will be considered as Crude Oil for the purposes of their sharing between the Parties under Article 16.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.3.3.  For the purpose of cost recovery under this Contract, the Natural Gas price, experessed in Dollars per million BTU, shall be equal to<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	(a)	with respect to Natural Gas export sales to Third Parties, the price obtained from purchasers;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	(b)	with respect to sales on the local market of Natural Gas as a fuel, such price as NOCAL and the Contractor shall agree<br /><br />
	<br /><br />
	       The above mentioned equivalent price for the utilization of Natural Gas as a fuel shall be determined on the basis of the same calcirfic value with respect to commercial gas delivered at the entry point of the main gas transportation network, if any, or otherwise where delivered to large consumers. In the event of transfer of the gas at a delivery point located upstream, the selling price shall be adjusted accordingly.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
									44	21.3.4. In the event of the discovery of a Natural Gas <br /><br />
        field which may not be commercial at that time, <br /><br />
        the Contractor shall not be required to proceed <br /><br />
        with the appraisal and development of the <br /><br />
        Natural Gas field until it is commercial to <br /><br />
        develop. An exclusive Appraisal Perimeter will <br /><br />
        be agreed by the Parties around the discovery of <br /><br />
        the Natural Gas field. The Contractor shall <br /><br />
        consult with NOCAL every five (5) years from the <br /><br />
        date of the discovery to examine alternatives <br /><br />
        for the economic and efficient development of <br /><br />
        the field. Not withstanding anything in the    <br /><br />
        Contract to the contrary, the Contractor shall <br /><br />
        not be required to surrender such Appraisal <br /><br />
        Perimeter for a period of five (5) years from <br /><br />
        the expiration of the exclusive exploration     <br /><br />
        authorization or the date on which the exclusive <br /><br />
        appraisal authorization (as it may be extensive <br /><br />
        in accordance with this Contract) for the <br /><br />
        discovery ends, which over is the later, and <br /><br />
        provided that. If the discovery is of Non <br /><br />
        Associated Natural Gas, the requirements for <br /><br />
        surrender set out in Articles 21.1.4 and 21.1.5 <br /><br />
        have been met.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.3.5. Notwithstanding any other provision of the <br /><br />

        NOCAL or the State (or any agency or <br /><br />
        instrumentally of the State) either (a) <br /><br />
        identifies a market for the said gas or (b) <br /><br />
        proposes to assign to, transfer to, grant or <br /><br />
        otherwise permit a Third Party to exercise any <br /><br />
        rights in relation to the appraisal, development <br /><br />
        and/or marketing of the gas, NOCAL shall <br /><br />
        promptly give written notice (the " Marketing <br /><br />

4.2   The Contractor, during the first exploration period defined in Article 3.1, shall carry out a minimum work programme at a cost of no less that eight million four hundred thousand (8.4 million) Dollars which includes a 3D Seismic Survey of 1,500 square Km.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contingent on a successful 3D seismic acquisition program and subsequent interpretation of the data, the Contractor undertakes to make reasonable efforts to drill one (1) exploratory well in the first period, but in any event not later than the middle of the second exploratory period, thereby satisfying the second exploration period minimum well commitment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.4   The Contractor, during the third exploration period defined in Article 3.1, shall carry out a minimum work programme at a cost of no less than twenty million five hundred thousand (20.5 million) Dollars which includes the drilling of two (2) exploratory wells.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.5   Each of the exploratory wells shall be drilled to a minimum depth of two thousand (2000) meters, after deduction of the water depth, or to a lesser depth if the continuation of drilling performed in accordance with good international petroleum industry practice is prevented for any of the following reasons:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
   (a)   The basement is encountered at a lesser depth than the minimum contractual depth,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
   (b)   Continuation of drilling presents an obvious danger due to the existence of abnormal formation pressure,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
   (c)   Rock formations are encountered the hardness of which prevents, in practice, the continuation of drilling by the use of appropriate equipment,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
   (d)   Petroleum formations are encountered the crossing of which requires, for their protection, the laying of casings preventing the minimum contractual depth from being reached.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that any of the above reasons occurs, the exploratory well shall be deemed to have been drilled to the minimum contractual depth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding any provision in this Article to the contrary, NOCAL and the Contractor may, at any time, agree to abandon the drilling of a well at a lesser depth then the minimum contractual depth.<br /><br />
